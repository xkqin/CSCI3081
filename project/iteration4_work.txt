Contains detailed work breakdown for iteration 4.

Dalton Stokke : 
      Added operator overload function declarations to matrix.h, implemented all function definitions in matrix.cc.
      Created paths in Makefile to compile codegeneration_tests.h, matrix.h, and matrix.cc.  Wrote my_code_1.dsl 
      sample test, as well as resprective trans.cc and .expected files.

Xukun Qin :
      Implemented CppCode funtion for all functions in Program.h, Stmts.h, Stmt.h, Decl.h, and Expr.h.  Wrote my_code_2.dsl
      sample test, as well as respective trans.cc and .expected files.

Jointly :
      Discussed general purpose of CppCode call, what role matrix.h and matrix.cc plays in sample tests, and ran through a
      few examples of operator overloading for matrix.cc.  Completed testing and google style check.

Comments:

Overall the project went very well, no major logical errors occurred and syntax issues were pretty easy to fix.  
We did run into an issue regarding the matrix files.  Specifically, the operator overloading functions proved confusing, 
and the use of friend and its purpose still elude me.  We opted not to override the copy constructor or the default destructor, 
and noticed a case during testing where given the 2 lines:
 1)  matrix ans = a * l;   
 2)  ans = ans;
line 1 will not result in a call to the overloaded assignment operator, but instead a call to the copy constructor, while
line 2 would result in a call to the assignment operator.  Since this had no impact on the function of the matrix class,
and the resulting assignment produced the correct results, no actions were taken.

The difficult parts of iteration 4 were as follows: the function building about the CppCode, because some of the functions proved
confusing between the unparesed function and the cppcode function, and the operator overloading part, understanding the meaning of 
overloading at first is hard, but after that the implementation of these functions becomes easier to accomplish.

In order to build the CppCode functions we needed to closely study the values in the provided samples, after considerable effort we
were able to discern the trends for the return values, and this helped speed up progress considerably.  We even added some spacing 
in order to improve the readability of the CppCode return value, though this was just aesthetics.
