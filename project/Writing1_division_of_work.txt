Writing Assignment 1 

Division of Work txt file

First a note: All changes to our scanner.h and scanner.cc files were done in lab, 
and improvements.pdf was written during that timeframe as well.  After changes were 
completed they were then explained in improvements.pdf, and once all issues had been
addressed, improvements.pdf was then edited for clarity and conciseness.

Qin Xukun:
	Addressed issues 4 and 6, due to the cause of the issues to be related to 
	the same problem of using integer literals as indexes in our array. 
	Addressed these issues by replacing those literals with the relevant 
	enumerated TokenType. 

Dalton Stokke:
	Created Scanner object constructor and moved regex_t array into that 
	constructor, while removing redundant regex_t pointer created to hold
	regex values before being placed into array.  Effectively handling 
	issues 2 and 5. Edited improvements.pdf to clarity and conciseness.
